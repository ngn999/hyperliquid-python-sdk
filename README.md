SDK for Hyperliquid API trading with Python.

</div>

## Installation
```bash
pip install hyperliquid-python-sdk
```
## Configuration 

- Set the public key as the `account_address` in examples/config.json.
- Set your private key as the `secret_key` in examples/config.json.
- See the example of loading the config in examples/example_utils.py

### [Optional] Generate a new API key for an API Wallet
Generate and authorize a new API private key on https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API, and set the API wallet's private key as the `secret_key` in examples/config.json. Note that you must still set the public key of the main wallet *not* the API wallet as the `account_address` in examples/config.json

## Usage Examples
```python
from hyperliquid.info import Info
from hyperliquid.utils import constants

info = Info(constants.TESTNET_API_URL, skip_ws=True)
user_state = info.user_state("0xcd5051944f780a621ee62e39e493c489668acf4d")
print(user_state)
```
See [examples](examples) for more complete examples. You can also checkout the repo and run any of the examples after configuring your private key e.g. 
```bash
cp examples/config.json.example examples/config.json
vim examples/config.json
python examples/basic_order.py
```

## Getting started with contributing to this repo

1. Download `uv`: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.

2. Point uv to correct version of python. For development we require python 3.10 exactly. Some dependencies have issues on 3.11, while older versions don't have correct typing support.
`brew install python@3.10 && uv python pin 3.10`

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

### Makefile usage

CLI commands for faster development. See `make help` for more details.

```bash
check-safety          Run safety checks on dependencies
cleanup               Cleanup project
install               Install dependencies from uv.lock
install-types         Find and install additional types for mypy
lint                  Alias for the pre-commit target
lockfile-update       Update uv.lock
lockfile-update-full  Fully regenerate uv.lock
uv-download           Download and install uv
pre-commit            Run linters + formatters via pre-commit, run "make pre-commit hook=black" to run only black
test                  Run tests with pytest
update-dev-deps       Update development dependencies to latest versions
```

## Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/releases) page.

We follow the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification and use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

### Building and releasing

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package with `uv version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`
- Create a `GitHub release`
- `uv build && uv publish`
